## Election-Prediction-Project-2022
### The Year 2022 appears to be filled up with political turmoil around the world which has been dampening public confidence in the governments and for the future.
### To keep things simple but effective, this small analysis project will use less than 5 variables to forecast the main Election Outcomes in the remaining months of 2022, namely:
### (1) UK new Prime Minister (Conservative Party Leader) after Liz Truss --- official result will be announced on 24th or 28th October depending on how many final candidates will be selected on the 24th October;
### (2) Brazilian Presidential Election (2nd Round) --- offical result will be announced on 30th October (31st October Australian Time);
### (3) US mid-term Elections which include "Senate Majority" and "House Majority" --- the elections are scheduled to be held on 8th November 2022;
### (4) Victoria State Election (overall), plus 2 specific districts: the Eildon district and the Mornington district; 


### Python3.10; Pylint, Beautifulsoup4 etc are used in the project
